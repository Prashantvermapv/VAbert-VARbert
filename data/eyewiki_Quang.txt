Diagnosis O
Symptoms O
Choroideremia B-pnt
becomes O
symptomatic O
during O
the O
first O
decade O
of O
childhood O
with O
the O
development O
of O
nyctalopia. B-pnt
It O
then O
progresses O
to O
peripheral B-pnt
vision I-pnt
loss I-pnt
in O
teenage O
years O
with O
sparing O
of O
central O
vision O
and O
maintenance O
of O
good O
visual O
acuity O
until O
the O
fifth O
to O
seventh O
decade O
of O
life.[10][32] O
At O
around O
the O
fifth O
decade O
of O
life, O
most O
patients O
develop O
a O
rapid B-pnt
deterioration I-pnt
in I-pnt
central I-pnt
vision.[33] I-pnt
Color O
vision O
is O
lost O
as O
degeneration O
of O
the O
macula O
takes O
place, O
and O
can O
occur O
prior O
to O
loss B-pnt
of I-pnt
visual I-pnt
acuity.[32][34] I-pnt
Phenotypic O
variation O
within O
a O
family O
can O
be O
striking, O
with O
some O
affected O
males O
significantly O
less O
affected O
than O
other O
males.[35] O
Carriers O
are O
generally O
asymptomatic, O
though O
female O
carriers O
may O
present O
with O
mild B-pnt
to I-pnt
moderate I-pnt
nyctalopia, I-pnt
with O
clinical O
findings O
of O
chorioretinopathy, B-pnt
RPE B-pnt
atrophy I-pnt
and O
granular B-pnt
pigmentary I-pnt
atrophy I-pnt
in I-pnt
the I-pnt
periphery.[36][37] I-pnt
Fundus O
Examination O
On O
fundus O
examination, O
the O
earliest O
manifestation O
is O
widespread B-pnt
pigment I-pnt
clumping I-pnt
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
RPE, B-pnt
which O
is O
distinct O
from O
the O
characteristic O
perivascular O
bone-spicule O
pigment O
clumping O
seen O
in O
retinitis B-pnt
pigmentosa.[10] I-pnt
Subsequently, O
patients O
develop O
well-defined O
regions O
of O
atrophy O
with O
visible O
underlying O
sclera O
and O
large O
choroidal O
vessels, O
most O
commonly O
in O
the O
postequatorial O
region O
just O
outside O
the O
vascular O
arcades. O
These O
areas O
of O
atrophy O
advance O
centripetally O
and O
are O
also O
found O
in O
a O
peripapillary O
and O
parapapillary O
manner O
(See O
image O
below).[10] O
An O
island O
of O
foveal O
tissue O
may O
persist O
until O
later O
stages O
of O
the O
disease O
when O
central O
and O
color O
vision O
become O
affected O
from O
foveal B-pnt
atrophy. I-pnt
Patients O
have O
preserved O
larger O
choroidal O
blood O
vessels O
and O
normal O
appearing O
retinal O
vessels. O
In O
addition, O
choroideremia O
exhibits O
no O
optic O
atrophy, O
unlike O
the O
waxy O
pallor O
of O
optic O
discs O
seen O
in O
retinitis O
pigmentosa. O
Carrier O
patients O
can O
have O
mild B-pnt
RPE I-pnt
changes, O
and O
in O
severe O
cases, O
patchy B-pnt
RPE I-pnt
degeneration I-pnt
and O
areas O
of O
atrophy.[10][38] O
This O
phenotypic O
variability O
in O
carriers O
is O
due O
to O
lyonization O
in O
which O
one O
copy O
of O
the O
X O
chromosome O
is O
randomly O
silenced O
early O
in O
embryogenesis. O
Other O
associated O
ocular O
findings O
include O
31% O
of O
patients O
developing O
posterior O
subcapsular O
cataracts O
and O
a O
small O
risk O
of O
macular O
edema O
or O
choroidal O
neovascularization.[39] O
Fluorescein O

On O
fluorescein O

scalloped O

choriocapillaris I-pnt
appear O
hypofluorescent O
next O
to O
brightly O
hyperfluorescent O
areas O
of O
perfused O
choriocapillaris O
(See O

Although O
not O
a O
common O
feature, O
choroidal B-pnt
neovascularization I-pnt
secondary O
to O
choroideremia O
can O
develop, O
leading O
to O

The O
scalloped O

of O

can O
clarify O
areas O
of O
the O

that O

on O

(See O

Hypoautofluorescence O
in O
the O

areas O
may O
precede O
photoreceptor O
cell O
death, O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
hypoautofluorescence O
may O
help O
predict O
disease O
activity O
and O
help O

patients O
undergoing O
a O

A O

may O
be O
observed O
in O
an O
otherwise O

in O
both O

As O

[21][31][32] O
One O

is O
a O
patchy B-pnt

of I-pnt

Progressive, B-pnt

In O

retina O
of O
the O
retinoschisis O
can O
develop O
large O
oval O
gaps. O
Subretinal O
linear O
fibrosis, O
pigmentation, O
white O
retinal O
flecks, O
vascular O
attenuation, O
and O
vascular O
sheathing O
may O
also O
be O
present. O
In O
extreme O
cases, O
the O
inner O
layer O
is O
absent O
with O
only O
the O
retinal O
vessel O
floating O
in O
the O
vitreous O
cavity O
which O
is O
called O
a O
vitreous O
veil. O
Peripheral O
dendritiform O
lesion O
which O
consist O
of O
sclerosed O
vessels O
may O
be O
noted. O
Visual O
function O
may O
be O
severely O
limited O
with O
progression O
to O
retinal O
detachment, O
which O
is O
most O
often O
rhegmatogenous O
and O
occurs O
in O
5-20% O
of O
cases. O
Vitreous O
hemorrhage O
is O
another O
common O
complication, O
especially O
with O
peripheral O
schisis, O
and O
may O
result O
in O
deprivation O
amblyopia. O
Hemorrhage O
may O
also O
occur O
within O
the O
schisis O
cavity. O
Other O
complications O
include O
intraretinal O
splitting, O
subretinal O
exudate, O
neovascular O
glaucoma, O
macular O
dragging, O
and O
optic O
atrophy. O
