She had an episode of hydrops in September 2013 in the right eye, and her vision is now HM in the right eye, 1/60 in the left.  She tells me that she had good unaided vision up until about the age of 12.  Rehabilitation of vision in the right eye would involve a corneal graft, and in view of her previous hyrops, this would be a penetrating keratoplasty.  The left cornea is unscarred, and it may be that visual rehabilitation may be achieved with a scleral contact lens, although I understand previous attempts have failed.  I have nonetheless booked her in to see if we can fit scleral contact lens here.    I note that she has asthma and mild atopic conjunctivits today, but is otherwise well, and takes no regular systemic medication.    She enquired about sight registration, and she is eligible for this, although it may well be in her interests to be registered more locally to her home.  I have suggested she take this letter to see if she can achieve this locally.

Mr ####### had undergone a previous course of intravitreal Lucentis treatment for a presumed occult subretinal neovascularisation secondary to age-related macular degeneration. This did not improve the subretinal fluid.  We have discussed the various treatment options for CSR (avoiding exogenous cortiosteroids; considering high endogenous steroids - Cushing's disease is rare in this type of presentation; photodynamic therapy - this therapy has not been funded by CCGs for the last 2 years for patients at Moorfields; oral eplerenone for a 3 months course - recent small case series published; focal argon laser to the source of leak).

There is no significant family history; his parents are not short-sighted.  On examination Freddie has very good unaided visual acuity of 0.00 logMAR in both eyes. On cover test he has a latent divergent strabismus (exophoria) when looking at a distance target; with near fixation there is a small intermittent left/alternating divergent squint (exotropia). His stereovision is reduced to 600 seconds of arc; Freddie found the test a bit tricky and this may be a performance issue and get better with repeated testing. Cycloplegic refraction shows Right -0.50/+0.50 x 90, Left -1.00/+0.50 x 90. This is very close to no prescription at all, and as his visual acuity is very good and his control over the squint is very good, Freddie does not need glasses at the moment. On fundoscopy, the optic nerve head and macula are healthy in both eyes.  In summary, Freddie has intermittent exotropia with good control, as his parents only notice it when he is tired. Freddie may become short-sighted in the future, and may benefit for glasses to see the whiteboard at school.  He does not need any treatment for exotropia at the moment. Future visits will continue to monitor his visual acuity, stereovision and controlled binocular acuity as a measure of squint control. Should treatment ever be required, glasses for shortsightedness can improve control. Surgery is a possibility, though the long-term benefits are unclear and often more surgery becomes necessary years after the first procedure.  I have discharged Freddie from follow-up."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-26T00:49:18.666742Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T03:42:33.356030Z","project":4}

Mr ##### is aware of a deterioration in his vision and after a long discussion, he has now been listed for a right cataract procedure. The cataract surgery will benefit him in more than one way; it will improve his vision, as there is no other pathology affecting his vision present in the eye and also, the angle will be opened preventing an acute angle closure attack.

I understand Anneliese's family have so far not used the ointment, because they fear it is too strong for the eye. Anneliese would benefit from this treatment, and it does not have any side-effects. Because the eye is so inflamed and the epithelium is intact, I have also prescribed a mild anti-inflammatory eye drop. This MUST only be used when also using aciclovir.

She was referred to me for a second opinion following two macular hole operations in her right eye.  More recently she has had cataract surgery without lens implantation.    On examination today her visual acuity was 6/60 in the right and 6/6 in the left eye.  She is aphakic in the right eye.  Otherwise anterior segment examination was unremarkable.  Fundal examination revealed a large macular hole in the right eye which was confirmed today on OCT.  In the left eye there was no abnormality.    I explained to Mrs ######### today that the visual prognosis for the right eye was very poor given her  two failed macular hole procedures.  I have explained to her that this may sometimes be the case following macular hole surgery and that full closure cannot always be guaranteed.  I did however offer her the chance for a further procedure with silicone oil to see whether or not we could achieve macular hole closure.  I have however stressed that the visual acuity following this may continue to be poor or the surgery itself may fail.  She is willing to accept this risk and we plan to perform the operation in February under local anaesthetic."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-26T00:49:18.574746Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T22:31:28.311618Z","project":4}
