Because the eye is so inflamed and the epithelium is intact, I have also prescribed a mild anti-inflammatory eye drop. This MUST only be used when also using aciclovir.

Diagnosis: Severe Diabetic Retinopathy Blind Left Eye Right Fibrovascular Traction and Preretinal/Vitreous Haemorrahge Dense Right Cataract  Unaided Vision: RE 1/60 LE NPL  Outcome: Listed for Right Cataract Surgery   This pleasant gentleman attended clinic after a recent drop in his vision in his only right eye. Examination revealed a dense right cataract and right fibrovascular retinal traction and haemorrahge. We discussed various management options including the implications of not intervening, the risks involved in a delamination procedure as well as a catract operation given this is his only eye. After discussion it was felt best to proceed with the right cataract in the first instance and review with the situation, with a delamination more than likley in the future to prevent further visual loss. As such we have listed Mr ####### for the procedure above on the 18th Jan 2013 and shall of course keep you informed of his progress. Diagnosis: Left lower lid post operative granuloma.  2.  Left lateral lower lid laxity.   I reviewed this pleasant 25 year old gentleman who was assaulted in August, 2012 in Portugal whilst on holiday and sustained a left orbital floor fracture which was repaired by the local maxfax team with a titanium mesh.  He unfortunately developed a wound site granuloma roughly ten days after the removal of sutures back in the UK which has been weeping and discharging causing the patient significant discomfort.    On examination there was a full range of ocular movements with normal colour vision and pupil responses and there appears to be a predunculated granuloma in the left lower lid measuring  10.1 x 7.5mm with no associated lagophthalmos and normal fundal examination.  Plan: In view of these findings we have put the patient on the waiting list for left lower lid tightening and excision of the granuloma on 21st December 2012.  He has been put on regular lubricants and Chloramphenicol ointment at night.   Kind regards. Diagnosis Bilateral pterygium R>L Bilateral pseudophakia  This 68 year old man attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit. He continues to have blurred vision in the right eye. Refraction showed some astigmatism which may improve if the pterygium is removed. I think he would benefit from surgery and I explained the risks and benefits to him, along with the 10% risk of recurrence. He has been listed for right pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft in March 2013 under LA. Mr ####### attended the corneal clinic today for a review. Diagnosis: Bil Conjunctival chalazis Blepharitis  He is still symptomatic despite proper blepharitis treatment. We are planning to remove the redundant conjunctiva of his right eye to improve his symptoms. He will be booked for the procedure in the near future. Diagnosis: Right aphakic (managed with CL) Left cataract Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy Early right aphakic bullous keratopathy Possible right aphakic glaucoma  Vision: RE 6/6 with CL, LE 6/12  This gentleman has early corneal decompensation in the right eye due to aphakia. AS he has normal vision with a contact lens, this requires no treatment at this stage. If it does progress to involve his central cornea, he may require a corneal transplant.  Mr ##### also has a left cataract, and after the discussion of risks and benefits, has been placed on the waiting list for left cataract surgery in February.  Finally, the intraocular pressure was also noted to be elevated in the right eye today; 29mmHg in the RE and 17mmHg in the LE. He appears to have some changes of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, but his requires review by the Glaucoma team at Moorfields. Could you kindly refer him to the Glaucoma Service for an appointment within 3 months? NEW PATIENT  This patient was reviewed in clinic today and the current situation is summarised below:  Plan:  This patient has been listed for right phakoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation under local anaesthetic as a day case at Mile End on the 20 February 2013. This 72 year old woman attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit.  Her principal diagnosis was a Right eye non ischaemic hemispheric branch vein occlusion. This has resolved leaving a few small collateral vessels at the optic disc.  She requires no treatment at the present time.   No further routine follow up is required, and I have discharged her. We will be happy to review her should she develop further problems. This patient was reviewed in clinic and the current situation is summarised below :-  Diagonsis:  Post right cataract surgery   Visual acuity : 6/9  Plan  This patient has been listed for left phakoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation under local anaesthetic as a day case at Mile End on the 20 February 2013. Diagnosis: 1 Left Pseudophakic Total PVR RD with a Full Thickness Macular Hole  2 Previous Left Cataract Extraction - Morocco 3 Left YAG Capsulotomy - Gibraltar 4 Right Cataract 5 Right AMD Changes 5 Left Lower Lid BCC   Aided Vision: RE 6/60 (6/36) LE HM    Outcome: Listed for Left RD Repair (Vitrectomy/Peel/ILM Peel/360 Laser/Oil - gaurded Prognosis 15/01/13 DC LA  Many thanks for referring this very pleasant gentleman who reports a 2 week history of reduced vision in his left eye. Examination revealed a left total retinal detachment with evidence of grade C PVR scarring of the retina. No break was identified however there was a full thickness macular hole noted. The gentleman will require complex detachment surgery and we have informed him of the risks and benefits as well as the very gaurded prognosis given the nature of the detachment. The surgrey will require the use of silicone oil which while in situ will leave him with reduced vision and he has been made aware that there is the real possibility of the oil being left in the eye long term. We have also explained that although the prognosis is very gaurded, if he opted for no intervention then this will result in the complete loss of sight in the left eye. He is keen to proceed and so we have listed him for surgery for Tuesday 15/01/13.  Examination also revealed a left lower lid BCC and we would be grateful if you could arrange for him to have this treated locally in Gibraltar. I would be grateful if this patient ould be seen in your clinic.

We are planning stromal puncture in the left eye. IOPs today were 30 mmHg R and 21 mmHg L.  CD ratios were 0.4 right and 0.9 left.  She tells me that, as far as she is aware, IOPs have never been raised in the past.  I have prescribed g latanoprost od in the right eye and will ask her GP to continue prescribing this until she see you. The above patient is booked to have a Left Retinal Detachment surgery (vitrectomy, peel, cryotherapy retinopexy, laser retinopexy, injection of silicone oil) under LA. He presented to the pre-operative asessment clinic with a blood pressure of 240/110 mmHg and pulse rate of 101/min. It was re-checked after 20 minutes and it went down to 190/100 mmHg.   The patient is not symptomatic except for occassional headaches and the only medication he takes are paracetamol. His /interpreter/friend attributes the high BP to nervousness and for fasting the whole morning for some reason.  He is adviced to see his GP as soon as he possibly can for some urgent blood pressure monitoring and treatment to prevent cancellation on day of operation.

DIAGNOSIS: bilateral cataracts  VISUAL ACUITY: 6/12 RE, 6/18 LE  MANAGEMENT: discussed risks, benefits, options of doing nothing and refractive outcome. Listed for left cataract surgery in the first instance, right eye to follow. I reviewed this pleasant forty-year old gentleman in the Lacrimal Clinic today.  He complains of a one-year history of right-sided epiphora with associated medial tearing and no other ocular symptoms or discharge from the eye.    He has no relevant past medical history in terms of sinus issues or atopy and is otherwise fit and well.  There is no other previous ophthalmic history.  On examination there is a slightly raised tear film in the right in comparison to the left and again a slight delay in the fluorescein disappearance test in the right compared to the left, but he otherwise has a normal examination bilaterally on the slit lamp.  Upon syringing however he does have moderate reflux, in the right more so than the left, however he assures me that he is completely asymptomatic in the left eye.

Thank you very much for referring this 81 year old woman whom I saw in the clinic today.   Her principal diagnosis is left cataract.   I think she would benefit from surgery and I explained the risks and benefits to her.   She has been listed for left phakoemulsification and iol and will be admitted on 30 Jan 2013. This young patient has advanced keratoconus and has run into major problems with her visual acuity on account of the refractive consequences of this shape disorder of the cornea.  At present in the right eye, he has very poor spectacle corrected visual acuity and awaits a contact lens for better vision.  This lens was ordered more than 2 months ago and is still not available for wear causing major hold ups with his work at school.  The additional problem is that he has very poor visual potential at present in the left eye with scarring itself secondary to rupture of his membrane of the cornea.  Surgery to replace the cornea with a left transplant has been scheduled for 25th March and the visual rehabilitation following the surgery may well take several months.  We will try to arrange dispensing of the contact lenses as quickly as possible.  I would support Ssyful-Islam\\'s request for special allowances to be made in regard to his examinations at school.  He has had major visual difficulties during the past school year and I would be happy to provide any further medical information that may be required by the school to support any request by his parents.

We have offered surgical correction of this squint. We have discussed the risks of over/undercorrection, the slight risk of loss of vision, a small risk of diplopia. Date of surgery has been offered for July for further detailed discussions/ consenting and remeasurements of her squint.  She will be seen about two weeks prior to surgery. Diagnosis: BE cataract  I saw this gentleman in clinic today with a view to cataract surgery.  He did not wear his own specs for distance vision for the eye test and the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 6/24 bilaterally, improving to 6/9 with ph.  On the ocular examiantion he presented with bilateral cataracts and no significant fundus abnormalities.  We discussed the risks and benefit of surgery, we also discussed the alternative of not undergoing surgery and wear the required and appropriate distance glasses which should guarantee him a level of vision close to what achieved with the ph.  Mr #### haso also a significant corneal astigmatism, exceeding the 2 dioptres in both eyes, hence I warned him that he might require distance and reading glasses following surgery.  I also informed him of the characteristics of the multifocal and toric lenses, which are only available in private practice.  Mr #### was keen on proceeding with surgery to the left eye, with the implantation of a standard monofocal IOL. Accordingly, I have listyed him for surgery. I reviewed Mrs ######### today in my Vitreoretinal Clinic.  She was referred to me for a second opinion following two macular hole operations in her right eye.  More recently she has had cataract surgery without lens implantation.    On examination today her visual acuity was 6/60 in the right and 6/6 in the left eye.  She is aphakic in the right eye.  Otherwise anterior segment examination was unremarkable.  Fundal examination revealed a large macular hole in the right eye which was confirmed today on OCT.  In the left eye there was no abnormality.    I explained to Mrs ######### today that the visual prognosis for the right eye was very poor given her  two failed macular hole procedures.  I have explained to her that this may sometimes be the case following macular hole surgery and that full closure cannot always be guaranteed.  I did however offer her the chance for a further procedure with silicone oil to see whether or not we could achieve macular hole closure.  I have however stressed that the visual acuity following this may continue to be poor or the surgery itself may fail.  She is willing to accept this risk and we plan to perform the operation in February under local anaesthetic. Diagnosis: Bilateral Full Thickness Macular Holes Bilateral Cataracts  Aided Vision: RE 6/24 LE 6/24  Outcome: Listed for Left Vity / Peel / Gas  Many thanks for referring this delightful lady wiho reports a reduction in both eyes with the left eye affected more recently. OCT and clinical examination revealed bilateral cataracts and macular holes. We discussed the risks and benefits of surgery including the implications of gas and cataract accleration. Mrs #### is clean to proceed and we have listed her for surgery in early April. We shall of course keep you informed of her progress.

Mr ##### underwent successful cataract surgery in the left eye in January. He achieves an excellent post-operative vision in this eye and it has healed well.  He has a significant amount of cataract present in the right eye and is keen to have surgery to remove the cataract. I have therefore listed him for a Left cataract operation. Thank you very much for referring this 83 year old man whom I saw in the clinic today.

She has had multiple EDTA chelations and PTKs.   We are considering an autokeratoplasty (switching the right and left corneas) in the future, and would like your opinion regarding the possibility and safety of removal of the silicone oil in order to reduce the risk of calcium build up in the corneal transplant.  A routine appointment in the VR clinic would be much appreciated. This 64 year old man attended the clinic follow-up after cataract surgery in the left eye 5/2/2013. He feels his vision is improved but notes some floaters in the peripheral visual field. He has vitreous syneresis with no evidence of retinal tear or detachment.  He is listed for cataract surgery in the right eye on April 9th. This lady was referred to the Glaucoma Service via our colleagues in the Medical Retina Service where she is seen for diabetic retinopathy.  A concern was raised about optic disc asymmetry.    Ms Amin does indeed have some features suspicious for glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye.  She also has significant posterior subcapsular cataract in both eyes.  In the first instance, I have recommended commencing IOP lowering treatment and also to put her on the waiting list for left cataract surgery.  She has agreed to this course of action.  I have therefore prescribed her G. Xalatan nocte to both eyes and I have put her on the waiting list for left phacoemulsification + insertion of intraocular lens to be undertaken as a local anaesthetic day case procedure.  She will receive a date for the surgery in due course and I have arranged to see her again in 3 months time.  I would be grateful if you would continue the Xalatan as a repeat prescription. I was delighted to review Ms Kukurudza at the Adenxal clinic today.  Examination revealed bilateral Dermatochalasis and ptosis more on the left side. The pros and cons of surgical intervention has been discussed with Ms Kukurudza and he is keen of surgery. Therefore, we are going to list her for bilateral belpharoplasty and ptosis correction in due time.

There was no evidence of active neovascularization today. His RE is comfortable. His LE has chronic CSMO. He had laser treatment for this in the past with no evidence of benefit. He also had 3 IVTA injections in the past with some documented improvement adn no sign of steroid responsiveness. His old FFAs show evidence of ischaemia in his LE fovea , and this is a limiting factor in terms of the expected benefit from any of the potential interventions for his LE macular oedema. However the patient is one eyed at the moment and he feels that his vision in the LE is getting worse. Today he had gross macular oedema which rendered laser treatment difficult. After discussing the potential risks and benefits of the alternative treatment we decided to proceed with a IVTA LE.

Her visual acuity was 6/18-2 (corrected in both eyes) and the intraocular presssure was normal. The left eye has settled nicely and posterior examination shows a large myopic stapyloma extending into the macula on the left however the right macula appears relatively healthy.  I have explained that her post-op vision is reduced due to the myopic macular degeneration. I have listed her for the right eye and hope that her vision improves once this is done.

Visual fields full  He has been listed for left phakoemulsification and iol and an admission date will be arranged shortly. This 51 year old man was discharged from hospital today.   - Diagnosis: nanophthalmos, primary angle-closure glaucoma  - Operation: right clear lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation, and surgical iridectomy  Comments Pre-op IOP was 38mmHg on diamox. Post op IOP is 22mmHg today off Diamox. His visual acuity unaided is 6/18+2. Even though biometry suggested a + 50D IOL be used, I decided to use our strongest \"stock\" IOL (+40.0 D SA60AT), on the basis that biometry in patients with angle-closure is very inaccurate, and there is a tendence for a significant myopic overshoot if biometric formulae are followed. For my records, I\\'d be very interested to know his final refractive outcome.   His anterior chamber is formed, with no iridocorneal contact. I suggest he stays on atropine at a minimum of twice a day for 6 weeks. I have warned him about the symptoms of aqueous misdirection (blurring +/- pain). If this does happen, options include laser zonulotomy/hyaloidotomy through the surgical iridectomy and/or inferior sectoral diode laser cycloablation (treating with 5-6 shots). I\\'d be happy to discuss, and see him again, if this happens, if you wish. However, things seem to be be going very smoothly at the moment.

No further follow up is required, and I have discharged him from the clinic. Thank you very much for referring this visually impaired 60 year old man whom I saw in the clinic today together with his daughter.  His principal diagnosis is right complex cataract in his only eye.He has a mobile lens with zonular dehiscence. His left eye has no useful vision from previous trauma and optic atrophy.  He has been listed for right cataract surgery  with planned anterior vitrectomy and anterior chamber IOL under intravenous sedation. An admission date will be arranged shortly and I plan to do the surgery myself. Diagnosis:  Left cataract surgery 8th March 2013              Right cataract   Visual acuity: Right: 6/12-2, 6/9-1PH  Left: 6/18, no improvement PH  This patient was reviewed in the clinic today following cataract surgery to her left eye two weeks ago.  Her eye is settling down well and the vision feels brighter.  Unfortunately there has not been any improvement in the snellen acuity as the left eye is amblyopic.  She is keen to have the right cataract surgery done as the right eye is significantly hypermetropic and she is struggling with the imbalance.  She also feels the vision in the right eye is quite dull now.  Her left eye is settling well. There is a suture in the cornea but we will leave this until next time to remove.  I have listed her for right cataract surgery under local anaesthetic in view of the anisometropia and the fact that her right anterior chamber drainage angle is slightly narrow. We will keep you informed as to her progress.

This 6 year old boy attended the children\\'s Accident and Emergency department today. Ezriel scratched his left eye three days ago and was started on Occ Chloramphenicol three times a day. Today his eye is more comfortable, but his vision is still hazy. On examination visual acuity is 6/7.5 in both eyes. The left corneal abrasion has healed, but there is still stromal inflammation, making his vision hazy. There is no inflammation inside the eye.  I have advised using Occ Chloramphenicol for another week, four times a day if possible. We will review him in one week. Thank you very much for referring this 67 year old man whom I saw in the clinic today. His principal diagnosis is bilateral cataracts  .

She was listed for bilateral sequential phaco, RE first. Thank you very much for referring this 79 year old woman whom I saw in the clinic today.  Diagnosis: Bilateral pseudophakia Left posterior capsular opacification Treatment: Left Yag laser capsulotomy G Maxidex tds for one week left eye. No further follow up is required, and I have discharged her. This 4 year old girl attended the clinic for a follow up visit after attending A&E on 29/6/2013. Her left eye surface is very inflamed. This is likely to be a reactivation of a herpes simplex virus infection; in addition, Anneliese has chronic lid margin inflammation (blepharitis), which makes her eye surface very vulnerable. Today her visual acuity in the left eye is reduced to 6/24; visual acuity in the right eye is 6/7.6. There is a dense opacity in the left central cornea, extending upwards. The epithelium is intact.  The best treatment for herpes simplex is an eye ointment, which is specific for use on the eye. I understand Anneliese\\'s family have so far not used the ointment, because they fear it is too strong for the eye. Anneliese would benefit from this treatment, and it does not have any side-effects. Because the eye is so inflamed and the epithelium is intact, I have also prescribed a mild anti-inflammatory eye drop. This MUST only be used when also using aciclovir.  For the blepharitis, I have recommended daily warm lid compresses and lid margin cleaning and have given Anneliese\\'s father a leaflet to explain how to do these. We will review Anneliese in Mr ######## clinic next week. Diagnosis: Keratoconus - Right corneal transplant (Oct 2011) Right cataract IOP steroid responder  Vision: RE 6/36, LE PL  Mx: g.Lotemax od RE g.Timolol 0.25% bd RE  I reviewed this gentleman in the Cornea clinic. His corneal transplant is clear, but he has developed a cataract in that eye. His intraocular pressure is also elevated today in response to the dexamethasone eye drops.  We have booked him for right cataract surgery and removal of graft suture removal in September. I have also altered his eye drop regimen to the above. I would appreciate it if you could ensure he has ongoing prescriptions. This 61 year old man was discharged from hospital today.   - Diagnosis: rhegmatogenous retinal detachment - macula off  - Operation: Right Vitrectomy, Right Retinopexy using cryotherapy, Right Injection of gas  - Prescription: Chloramphenicol 0.5% eye drops, 1 drop(s) qid Eye (Right) for 14 days Dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops, 1 drop(s) qid Eye (Right) for 1 month Cyclopentolate 1% eye drops, 1 drop(s) bd Eye (Right) for 7 days  No GP action is required.

Visual fields are unreliable.  No treatment is required at present.  Follow Up: A follow up appointment has been made for few months. This 14 year old boy attended the clinic for a follow up visit. He presented with left contact-lens related pseudomonas keratitis on 16/05/2013, which has since then been slowly resolving on topical levo/moxifloxacin and steroids. Today visual acuity is right logMar 0.40, left 0.22 with glasses; with pinhole: Right 0.08, left 0.00. The left epithelial defect has healed. There is a stromal scar with minimal stromal inflammation. There are no inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber. The intraocular pressure measures 15mmHg. Cup disc ratio is 0.4. The right cornea has a small rust ring embedded near the nasal limbus, which I have removed.  I have re-prescribed G Moxifloxacin and G Dexamethasone 0.1% twice daily left eye, to be tapered to once daily in four weeks, and to be stopped in two months. I have discharged Samuel, as the family are moving to India next week. His parents will seek referral to a local ophthalmologist for ongoing care. This lady\\'s right full thickness macular hole has closed following surgery in April. She has now developed a right cataract.  She has been listed for right phakoemulsification and iol and will be admitted on 16 Sep 2013. Thank you very much for referring this 80 year old woman whom I saw in the cataract clinic today.

He does not need any injection today.  He will be reviewed in 6 weeks.  The patient has been advised that if they notice any new distortion on the Amsler grid, they should attend an ophthalmologist urgently within 24-48 hours. Thank you very much for referring this 76 year old woman who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   She has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   Her visual acuity was 6/9 right and 6/12 left.  After a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgery she elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for: left phakoemulsification and iol Diagnosis: R: Raised pterygium  We reviewed Mrs ######### in the Corneal service at City Road today with the above diagnosis. She was referred to us for consideration of pterygium excision.  Examination today revealed a raised pterygium in the right eye, which Mrs ######### feels affects her day to day life. She is very keen to have this removed to improve the comfort of her eye. Otherwise her eyes appeared bilaterally very healthy.  Unaided vision measured R: 6/24 PH 6/6 and L: 6/18 PH 6/6.  Following review by the consultant in clinic we have arranged for her to have the pterygium excised on 2nd April 2014.   She will be reviewed post-operatively.

There is no doubt that she meets criteria for keratoconus in both eyes, but retain good unaided vision with no correction in the left eye.  At 51 years old, and with no subjective changes to her vision within the last few years, it is unlikely that her condition will deteriarate.    She tells me it is 20 years since she last tried contact lenses.  I have arranged for her to be followed up with the contact lens practitioners here.  I have not arranged to see her again routinely, but would be happy to should she have further questions or problems with her eyes. Thank you very much for referring this 65 year old woman who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   She has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   Her visual acuity was 6/60 improving to 6/9 with pinhole right and 6/9 unaided left.

Listed for right Cataract extraction and Lens Implant (Date to be arranged) Diagnosis: Hypermetropia  Comment:  Isabel wears glasses for hypermetropia, which slightly undercorrect her actual prescription. She does not have any problems with her vision, particular no difficulty seeing at night. Her visual acuity is perfect with her current glasses, at -0.100 logMAR in both eyes, and so is her 3D vision (stereopsis), at 55 seconds of arc. Her eyes are straight, there is esophoria only (a slight tendency for the eyes to drift inward, which is controlled with both eyes are open). On cycloplegic refraction, I found a hypermetropic prescription of Right +7.00/+0.50x90 and Left +7.50DS. The ocular media are clear, and optic nerve head, macula and retina are healthy in both eyes.  In view of her excellent vision and stereovision I would not recommend changing her glasses. She should have a test for glasses once a year. I have discharged her from follow-up. We reviewed Mrs ######## in the clinic today.  She is myope at about -9 RE and has significant cortical and posterior subcapsular cataract. VA RE is 6/36.  VA LE is HM. She had previous cataract surgery in 2012 but has LE macular scar.

We also discussed the option of conservative management, i.e. not doing surgery.  Benefits: good chance of improving the vision if successful Risks: 1 in 1000 of severe visual loss due to an infection and 1 in 100 of operative complications which may require another operation or limit the vision permanently. We will aim to correct distance vision after cataract surgery, however distance glasses are sometimes required after surgery to get the clearest possible vision. All patients will also require glasses for reading after surgery.    Following discussion of the risks and benefits we have listed the above patient for cataract surgery. Thank you very much for referring this 47 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   He has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.

He has been referred to his CCG\\'s diabetic retinopathy screening programme who will review him in one year time. Thank you very much for referring this 68 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   He has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   His visual acuity was 6/12 right and 6/9 left.  We have discussed the benefits and risks of surgery, as well as the option of not having any treatment at present. The risks of surgery discussed: 1:1000 risk of severe complication which could mean permanent visual loss, 1: 100 risk of requiring additional surgery for various reasons, 1:20 risk of a less serious complication, 1:10 need for a laser procedure to clear capsule opacification within a few years after the surgery.  As he has a longstanding exophoria with L/R, we have discussed the possibility of phoria decompensation after cataract surgery which could result in double vision with further treatment being needed, including prism glasses and possible squint surgery.  Also, refractive outcomes were discussed including the option of having toric lens implanted.

Mr ##### is aware of a deterioration in his vision and after a long discussion, he has now been listed for a right cataract procedure. The cataract surgery will benefit him in more than one way; it will improve his vision, as there is no other pathology affecting his vision present in the eye and also, the angle will be opened preventing an acute angle closure attack. I have restarted Mr ##### on the pilocarpine and would be very grateful if you could please provide all of the above drops on repeat prescription until further notice. Mr ##### has also been started on lid hygiene treatment to reduce/stop the blepharitis. He will be seen again in the clinic in 6-8 weeks (just before his surgery).

Thank you very much for referring this 85 year old man whom I saw in the clinic today.  His principal diagnosis is Bilateral nuclear cataract.  He has been listed for right phakoemulsification and iol and an admission date will be arranged shortly. Diagnosis: Right Pseudophakia            Bilateral Dry Age Related Macula Degeneration, Right>Left  Visual Acuity: RE 6/12+2 - PH: 6/9+3, LE 6/36+1 - PH: 6/24-1  Comments: I reviewed this 76 year old gentleman in Primary Care. He denies any visual problems but was sent by his optician for a YAG Capsulotomy. He himself has not noticed any new vision problems but does noticed a difference between his right and left eye.  On examination, both anterior segments were unremarkable. The right eye had an IOL in situ with a clear posterior capsule. The left eye had a nuclear sclerotic cataract. On fundoscopy, there were drusen at both macula, right>left.  I have explained to Mr. ###### that he has age related macula degernation, right>left. I have also offered to do his left cataract which he has agreed to. He has been listed for a left phaco+IOL insertion on July 1 2014. Diagnosis: Bilateral cortical cataracts (Right>>Left)  VAR 6/36+1 UA 6/12 PH VAL 6/12-2 UA 6/12 PH  Summary: The gentleman gives a 4-5 year insidious history of bilateral blurred vision (right>left). I note he has previously had a normal FFA & OCT (Sutton Hospital). The OCT repeated today revealed no central IRF/SRF. There is a possibility of an area of right superior retinal thickening seen. However, this would not explain the visual history. The quality of the image was suboptimal secondary to the cortical cataracts.  Plan: Waiting list for right cataract extraction with IOL (22/04/2014) & Review OPD (01/05/2014) Diagnosis Intermittent left/alternating exotropia  Comment Freddie\\'s family have noticed that his left eye wanders when he is tired.  There is no significant family history; his parents are not short-sighted.  On examination Freddie has very good unaided visual acuity of 0.00 logMAR in both eyes. On cover test he has a latent divergent strabismus (exophoria) when looking at a distance target; with near fixation there is a small intermittent left/alternating divergent squint (exotropia). His stereovision is reduced to 600 seconds of arc; Freddie found the test a bit tricky and this may be a performance issue and get better with repeated testing. Cycloplegic refraction shows Right -0.50/+0.50 x 90, Left -1.00/+0.50 x 90. This is very close to no prescription at all, and as his visual acuity is very good and his control over the squint is very good, Freddie does not need glasses at the moment. On fundoscopy, the optic nerve head and macula are healthy in both eyes.  In summary, Freddie has intermittent exotropia with good control, as his parents only notice it when he is tired. Freddie may become short-sighted in the future, and may benefit for glasses to see the whiteboard at school.  He does not need any treatment for exotropia at the moment. Future visits will continue to monitor his visual acuity, stereovision and controlled binocular acuity as a measure of squint control. Should treatment ever be required, glasses for shortsightedness can improve control. Surgery is a possibility, though the long-term benefits are unclear and often more surgery becomes necessary years after the first procedure.  I have discharged Freddie from follow-up. Thank you very much for referring this 82 year old man whom I saw in the clinic today. He has bilateral cataracts and bilateral dry AMD. We have discussed in detail the risks and benefits of an operation , the guarded prognosis due to AMD and the option of doing nothing. He is keen to have an operation in the LE.

Diagnosis: mild congenital ptosis left eye.  On examination visual acuity was normal for age. The ocular motility was normal and eye alignment was straight. The left eye lid droops 2 mm and levator function is moderate. Pupils are clear. Fundus exam was unremarkable.  We will keep William under regular review. Thank you very much for referring this 83 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   He has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   His visual acuity was 6/12 right and 6/6 left.  We have discussed the benefits and risks of surgery, as well as the option of not having any treatment at present. The risks of surgery discussed: 1:1000 risk of significant complication which could mean permanent visual loss, 1: 100 risk of requiring additional surgery for various reasons, 1:20 risk of a less serious complication, 1:10 need for a laser procedure to clear posterior capsule clouding within a few years after the surgery.  Guarded prognosis due to possible right amblyopia was discussed.  Also, alternative procedures (multifocal IOL not available on NHS) and refractive outcomes were discussed including a need to wear glasses for reading or astigmatic correction for distance after the surgery.  After  fully addressing all questions and concerns, Mr. ######### elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for: RIGHT phacoemulsification and IOL. Thank you very much for referring this 9 year old boy whom I saw in the clinic today because of possible decompensating eye alignment with his glasses.   On examination visual acuity in the right eye was 0.00 logMAR and 0.00 logMAR in the left eye. Near vision was N5. There was an intermittent exotropia with good control. Cycloplegic refraction measured RE +3/-0.25x20 and LE +3.25/-0.25x20. Fundus exam was normal.  As Thomas has no complaints of headaches nor problems when reading, we advised him not to wear his glasses. He has an exotropia together with mild hypermetropia; wearing the glasses might decompensate the current control of the exotropia.  We have referred him back to his local opticians for future follow-up. This patient was reviewed in the glaucoma clinic today.

We will schedule lens extraction for this patient very soon but in the meantime we have prescribed g. Pilocarpine 2% qds and g. Cosopt bd to the right eye.   Review 4 weeks Thank you very much for referring this 63 year old woman whom I saw in the clinic today.   Her principal diagnosis is left macular hole.  RVA 6/12. LVA 6/36.  Previous right macular hole surgery and pseudophakia.  This patient has worsening blurred vision and distortion in the left eye. There is a full-thickness macular hole present. I think she would benefit from surgery and I explained the risks and benefits to her. She has been listed for left vitrectomy, left internal limiting membrane peel, left injection of gas and will be admitted on 18 Mar 2015, under LA. She appreciates that the final visual prognosis is guarded. Diagnosis:  Right central serous retinopathy (CSR)  Right choroidal naevus  Recent diagnosis bony metastases - presumed prostate primary - under investigation Previous diagnosis prostate cancer - 2009 , 2013 - radiotherapy Previous lobectomy lung carcinoma 1999    Visual acuity: Right 6/60 pinhole 6/12 ; Left 6/12 pinhoe 6/6 Intraocular pressure normal both eyes  Retinal imaging studies today: OCT - persistent subretinal fluid Angiography - fluorescein and indocyanine green - no evidence of ocular metastases; right central serous retinopathy with similar origin of leak as in 2014 B scan ultrasound right eye - no evidence of mass lesion right eye; macular naevus flat  Comment; I reviewed Mr ####### in the medical retina service today. The right macular naevus remains stable. There is persistent right subretinal fluid. Mr ####### had undergone a previous course of intravitreal Lucentis treatment for a presumed occult subretinal neovascularisation secondary to age-related macular degeneration. This did not improve the subretinal fluid.  We have discussed the various treatment options for CSR (avoiding exogenous cortiosteroids; considering high endogenous steroids - Cushing\\'s disease is rare in this type of presentation; photodynamic therapy - this therapy has not been funded by CCGs for the last 2 years for patients at Moorfields; oral eplerenone for a 3 months course - recent small case series published; focal argon laser to the source of leak).

Visual acuity: Right Eye: 6/18 Pinhole Left Eye: 6/12 Pinhole  Diagnosis: Bilateral hypertensive retinopathy Bilateral non proliferative diabetic retinopathy Bilateral visually significant cataracts  Blood pressure today 157/97 Randon blood sugar: 10.8 mmol/L  Mrs ######## has noted a gradual decline in her vision over the last year and a visit to her optician showed widespread retinal haemorrhages which prompted her referral here. She is a long standing history of poorly controlled  hypertension and diabetes, and recently has been diagnosed with impaired renal function secondary to above. She tells me that is now undergoing investigations to address the above.   From an ophthalmic perspective she has visually significant cataracts in both eyes and evidence of non proliferative diabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy. There is no macula odema or and retinal neovascualrisation that requires immediate treatment. However, she will need to be closely monitored. She will also benefit from cataract surgery, but this is best done in the context opf stable retinal disease. I have given her information on cataract surgery and I have suggested that she tries to optimise her blood sugar levels and blood pressure with yourself.   We will review her in 3 months and we can consider cataract surgery then if appropriate. I have also suggested a formal refraction with us in teh near future. This gentleman has a lower pressure in his left eye now than previously documented (4mmHg) but his corrected acuities are: right 6/5-2 corrected and left 6/9 (stable) and there are no sequelae of hypotony in his left eye.  I have advised him of symptoms to look out given the low pressure.  He should also wear a shield at night and be careful not to rub his eye or do any heavy lifting.  His right eye looks to be settling down well after his cataract surgery 5 weeks ago. I have given hi another subconjuinctival injection of dexamethasone and lignocaine as his right bleb is looking a little inflamed.  He has no uveitis but he does have a small area of retained cortical lens matter in his right anterior chamber which happens very occasionally after cataract surgery, particularly in myopic patients.  We have planned to remove this under local anaesthetic in the new year but will see him again before, as if it is adsorbed spontaneously then we can cancel this operation.  In the interim his drops are:  g decxamethasone PF 6 x day RIGHT eye until review g chlorampheicol PF  QDS RIGHT eye 5 days The patient attended a nurse-led post-op cataract clinic today.

This lady is a referral from the cataract service.   Bilateral pseudophakia  This Arabic-speaking lady underwent a left cataract surgery which was uncomplicated on 4/4/2016. Pre-operative vision was 6/9. Prior to surgery the fundus was reported as normal in appearance. The day after surgery, she noted vision had deteriorated significantly. It has remained unchanged since then.  ON examination there is retrohyaloid collection of degenerating blood at the macula. Inferiorly, there is a large elevated lesion with subretinal material surrounded by pigment. Immediately nasal to the left large lesion, there is a hamorrhagic lesion. On  ICG, there was extensive blocking and no macular leaking vessels could be identified.  Fluoroscein angiogram showed there is active leakage from the small inferior haemorrhagic lesion c/w a CRNVM  We will obtain a spectralis OCT at City road through the lesions and USS B scan to ensure there is no part of the larger lesion where the appearance is consistent with a malignancy.  The primary differentials are active eccentric disciform  and polyploidal chorioretinopathy.  We will see her in 2 weeks Thank you very much for referring this 77 year old woman whom I saw in the clinic today.   Her principal diagnosis is Left cataract.

Mrs ######## was keen to proceed. She understands that the aim of surgery would not be to increase the number of letters she sees on the chart, but to remove the area of blurring just off her central axis which she describes as a \\'greasy film\\' which is troubling her. She understands the risks associated with surgery and the option of waiting until the vision worsens, but was keen to proceed.   She has been listed for Wednesday 21st October, and needs to arrive in the hospital at 7.30am. Thank you for referring this lady with cataracts and right amblyopia. She is aware of a deterioration in her left vision and felt her right vision was slightly better than before. I have discussed the risks and benefits of cataract surgery with her and that this is her better eye. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with a left phacoemulsification and intraocular lens insertion under local anaesthesia. I have discussed the refractive aim options and she would like to reduce her prescription and has been warned of the risk of anisometropia she may or may not (due to right amblyopia) experience. She is aware that she may need her right cataract removed if she does experience anisometropia. Thank you very much for referring this 81 year old woman whom I saw in the clinic today.

Referral for Glaucoma review  Mr ######## attended for a routine contact lens check for Keratoconus, he wears spectacles for the right eye VA = 6/5- and the left wears a rigid contact lens VA = 6/18. We have recently been monitoring his visual fields which are repeatably outside normal limits and he has some asymmetry of the disc cupping, R = 0.2, L = 0.55. His intraocular pressures are within normal limits (R = 12 mm Hg, L = 10 mm Hg by Goldmann tonometry at 4:40pm) but due to his Keratoconus these are unreliable due to his thin corneas (Pachymetry R = 529 um, L = 495 um).   Due to the repeatable field defect in both eyes, I would be very grateful if you would refer this 42 year old man to the Glaucoma service at Moorfields Eye Hospital for further assessment. We will continue to review him routinely in the contact lens clinic and see him in 6 months time.

This 42 year old woman attended the Accident and Emergency department, and was referred on to the clinic. She noted an inferior visual field loss on Sunday (3 days ago) which worsened to involve the central vision on Wednesday morning. When seen yesterday in casualty her vision was 6/36 and she had a macular off retinal detachment. She was asked to come in today (starved) as there is always a chance that we can undertake next day retinal detachment surgery as long as there are not too many other urgent cases. Today, she has an almost total detachment with vision of 1/60.   We have had to counsel her that she unfortunately has a low chance of getting a return of central vision, and that any surgery would be done primarily to retain what vision she has left in the right side.   She was offered surgery under local anaesthetic today but was understandably worried about keeping still for us, so would like general anaesthetic. She will be placed on the urgent list for right vitrectomy retinal detachment repair, to happen at some point over the next few days.   She will need to stay nil by mouth from midnight on the weekend days, and from 6am on weekdays, so that when we call her by 11am to come in she is able to have a general anaesthetic.

The risks of surgery discussed: 1:1000 risk of significant complication which could mean permanent visual loss, 1: 100 risk of requiring additional surgery for various reasons, 1:20 risk of a less serious complication, 1:10 need for a laser procedure to clear posterior capsule clouding within a few years after the surgery.  Also, refractive outcomes were discussed including a need to wear glasses for reading or distance after the surgery.  After fully addressing all questions and concerns, Mr ##### elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for: left phacoemulsification and IOL.

After a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgery he elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for: right phakoemulsification and iol. Consent signed by daughter. Diagnosis:  Advanced keratoconus both eyes  Outcome: Listed for penetrating keratoplasty right eye with a provisional date of 3rd July at St George\\'s hospital in Tooting.  Scleral contact lens fitting for the left eye  Many thanks for referring this 21yo woman with advanced keratoconus.  She had an episode of hydrops in September 2013 in the right eye, and her vision is now HM in the right eye, 1/60 in the left.  She tells me that she had good unaided vision up until about the age of 12.  Rehabilitation of vision in the right eye would involve a corneal graft, and in view of her previous hyrops, this would be a penetrating keratoplasty.  The left cornea is unscarred, and it may be that visual rehabilitation may be achieved with a scleral contact lens, although I understand previous attempts have failed.  I have nonetheless booked her in to see if we can fit scleral contact lens here.    I note that she has asthma and mild atopic conjunctivits today, but is otherwise well, and takes no regular systemic medication.    She enquired about sight registration, and she is eligible for this, although it may well be in her interests to be registered more locally to her home.  I have suggested she take this letter to see if she can achieve this locally.  We hope that eventually we may be able to get her to the situation where she no longer requires registration, but she may need assistance in the interim. Thank you very much for referring this 76 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   He has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   His visual acuity was 6/9 right and 6/9 left.

Left POAG with good IOP control 2. Left pseudophakia 3. Moderate myope  This patient is pleased with the vision in the left eye following uncomplciated cataract surgery and is now keen to have cataract surgery. He understands the risks and benefits and was keen to be listed today.  He will return for surgery on 7th June 2014 under LA with sedation. In the meantime he should continue with G.Azopt and G.Xalacom to the both eyes. Thank you very much for referring this 30 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   He has bilateral mild congenital cataracts which are not involving the visual axis. Indeed, his spectacle corrected visual acuity today was 6/5 right and 6/5 left.   Surgery currently is not indicated and I have discharged him from our service. The patient attended a nurse-led post-op cataract clinic today.  Diagnosis: Left Cataract  Procedure: Right Cataract extraction and Lens implant on the 3/4/14    Prescription: To reduce the G. Maxidex three times a day for 7 days and then twice a day for 7 days and then Once a day for 7 days then stop.     VA:  Right:     6/9                     Left:             6/9 IOP: Right:      16      mm/Hg   Left:    18              mm/Hg             Examination: On examination the eye looked well. The patient has been advised to complete the drops as stated above. If there are any problems in future, we will be happy to see the patient. No intervention from G.P. is needed at present.  Plan: 1. Listed for Left Cataract extraction and Lens Implant (Date to be arranged) Thank you very much for referring this 68 year old woman who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.  She has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.  Her visual acuity was 6/12 right and 6/36 left. After a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgery she elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for:  right phakoemulsification and iol Thank you very much for referring this 87 year old woman who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   She has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   Her visual acuity was 6/18 right and CF left.  After a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgery she elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for: Right phacoemulcification with IOL. Thank you very much for referring this 79 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   He has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   His visual acuity was 6/9 right and 6/9 left.  After a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgery he elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for:  right phakoemulsification and iol   We discussed the COMPLICATIONS, benefits, risks of cataract surgery and an information leaflet was given to the patient. We also discussed the option of conservative management, i.e. not doing surgery.  Benefits: good chance of improving the vision if successful Risks: 1 in 1000 of severe visual loss due to an infection and 1 in 100 of operative complications which may require another operation or limit the vision permanently. We will aim to correct distance vision after cataract surgery, however distance glasses are sometimes required after surgery to get the clearest possible vision. All patients will also require glasses for reading after surgery.    Following discussion of the risks and benefits we have listed the above patient for cataract surgery. Many thanks for asking me to see this gentleman with his left non-epithelialising corneal graft. He therefore underwent a left sided lateral and central prolene suture tarsorrhaphy on silicone bolsters which I hope will protect the graft and allow it to become epithelialised. When he looks to the right the graft can still be examined, and if necessary the central tarsorrhaphy can be removed once his graft begins to epithelialise.  With kind regards, She has been listed for left phakoemulsification and iol and will be admitted on 7 Aug 2014.   She has been prescribed Sodium hyaluronate 0.2% eye drops (No Preservative), 1 drop(s) prn Eye (Both) Until review Simple eye ointment, 1 strip nocte Eye (Both) Until review.   Please continue to prescribe the above - I understand she\\'s had problems obtaining repeat prescriptions.  Many thanks This 53 year old woman was reviewed in the Medical Retinal Service today.   Her Visual acuity was 6/5 on right eye and 6/5 on the left eye.  Diagnosis: Right macular branch retinal vein occlusion - resolved  Clinical Management:  No haemorrhages were noted today. There is no macular oedema.   Retinal vein occlusions are known to be associated with hypertension, elevated cholesterol and diabetes. I was told that the patient\\'s cholesterol was high,however she has not been started not on any treatment. Could you kindly review and do the needful?  We have decided to review her in 4 months. Thank you very much for referring this 77 year old woman who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   She has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   Her visual acuity was 6/12 right and 6/18 left.  After a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgery she elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for:  Right cataract surgery This 22 year old woman attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit.   Diagnosis: Decompensating exophoria.   Comment: Ms Haciepiri was reviewed in the Eye Clinic today. She has become increasingly aware of the divergent squint, particularly when she is tired or had alcohol to drink. Her symptoms mainly occur when she is looking at a computer screen for long periods of time and when she is at university while taking notes during classes. We discussed the pros and cons of surgery and have listed her for a right squint operation to bring the eyes back into their comfort zone where she will be able to control her squint better. We do not think she will tolerate an adjustable and probably wouldn\\'t tolerate a toxin injection either. Diagnosis: Right eye:    Mild nonproliferative retinopathy(NSC R3S and evidence of photocoagulation) No macular oedema(NSC M0 and no evidence of photocoagulation) Left eye:      End stage diabetic retinopathy (NSC U and evidence of photocoagulation)) Diabetes mellitus type 1  Visual acuity: Right Eye: 6/12 Glasses, 6/12 Pinhole Left Eye: NPL Glasses    She has been advised of the importance of optimal blood sugar and blood pressure control in reducing the risk of retinopathy and maculopathy worsening. The importance of regular follow-up has been emphasised. The left eye is comfortable with a cosmetic shell which is checked here every 3 months.    She will be reviewed in 12 months Thank you very much for referring this 84 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   His visual acuity was 6/24 right and 6/12 left.  He has developed a posterior capsule opacification in his right eye which can be resolved with YAG laser capsulotomy. There is also a marked epiretinal membrane with retinal thickening.  He has visually significant cataract in his left eye and should benefit from surgery, but he would prefer to wait with the procedure until he is sure about his right eye prognosis.   He has been listed for right YAG capsulotomy and we will see him in the clinic a week after the procedure to perform a retinal OCT scan.  I have also referred him to our vitreoretinal service for evaluation of the epiretinal membrane. Diagnosis  Keratoconus  Bilateral pseudophakia  Bilateral treated PDR   Mrs ######## keratoconus is stable. We once again discussed the options to imrove the vision in her left eye: contact lens or surgery. She is happy with her present level of vision and doesn\\'t wish to have further intervention at present. I have discharged her from the corneal clinic but she continues to attend the medical retina clinic. This 46 year old woman was discharged from hospital today.   - Diagnosis: Left rhegmatogenous retinal detachment - macula off  - Operation: Left Cryotherapy retinopexy, Left Scleral buckle  - Prescription: Apraclonidine 0.5% eye drops, 1 drop(s) tid Eye (Left) for 1 month Acetazolamide 250mg tablets, 1 tablet(s) qid PO for 7 days Chloramphenicol 0.5% eye drops, 1 drop(s) qid Eye (Left) for 14 days Dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops, 1 drop(s) qid Eye (Left) for 1 month Cyclopentolate 1% eye drops, 1 drop(s) bd Eye (Left) for 7 days  No GP action is required. The patient has been advised of the importance of taking their topical medication. She has been given an appointment for post-operative review in 2 weeks time. Thank you very much for referring this 55 year old woman whom I saw in the clinic today.   Her principal diagnosis is Bilateral nuclear cataract.   She has been listed for left phakoemulsification and IOL and will be admitted on 29 Aug 2014. This 63 year old woman attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit.  Her principal diagnosis is Left macular hole.   The macular hole has increased in size and remains open. Vision is 6/18 left and 6/6 right. We discussed a further period of observation but the condition has worsened, and I think she would benefit from surgery and I explained the risks and benefits to her. She has been listed for left phakoemulsification and iol, left vitrectomy, left internal limiting membrane peel, left injection of gas and will be admitted on 12 Sep 2014, local anaesthetic with sedation.  She apprecaites that the final visual prognosis is guarded. This 67 year old woman was discharged from hospital today.   - Diagnosis: Bilateral cataract  - Operation: Right Phakoemulsification and IOL  - Prescription: Chloramphenicol 0.5% eye drops, 1 drop(s) qid Eye (Right) for 14 days Dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops, 1 drop(s) 2 hourly Eye (Right) for 14 days    then 1 drop qid for 7 days    then 1 drop tid for 7 days    then 1 drop bd for 7 days    then 1 drop od for 7 days  No GP action is required. The patient has been advised of the importance of taking their topical medication. She has been given an appointment for post-operative review in 3 weeks time. This 44 year old man attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit.   His principal diagnosis is Usher syndrome with bilateral posterior subcapsular polar cataract. He is troubled by glare.  He has been listed for right phakoemulsification and IOL and will be admitted on 24 Oct 2014. He is aware that the final acuity will still be limited by his retinal disease. I would be very grateful if you would see this 55 year old woman who gives a very clear history of sudden (over a period of a week) deterioration in vision in both eyes which has persisted.  She was referred to me as she does have early cataracts in both eyes, but these would not explain her level of acuity of 6/24 in each eye with improvement to only 6/18 with pinhole. She had a diagnostic refraction, which I couldn\\'t find the record of, about 3 weeks ago and apparently this did not prove helpful.  In view of the incongruity of the history for presentation of cataracts and the disparity between cataract morphology and acuity, I would be grateful for your opinion.  I have given her an appointment for review with me in 6 months, but if you can find no other cause for her reduced vision, then I can see her sooner with a view to cataract surgery. Diagnoses Hypermetropia Anisometropia Left reduced visual acuity Left esotropia  Comment Juliet\\'s visual acuity is 0.100 logMAR in the right and 1.100 in the left eye. Prism cover test shows a left esotropia of 35 prism diopters for distance and 45 for near.

The importance of regular follow-up has been emphasised.   He will be reviewed in 6 months in the Medical Retina clinic. Thank you very much for referring this 88 year old man whom I saw in the clinic today.   Mr ##### has right bullous keratopathy, presumably secondary to complicated cataract surgery.  There is no evidence of corneal endothelial dystrophy.  Marked iris atrophy is present, which raises the possibility of herpetic corneal oedema, however the atrophy could be well explained by his past right angle closure glaucoma.   I have booked Mr ##### for endothelial keratoplasty on the 10th November.  3 weeks prior, I have asked him to commence a course of dexamethasone.  This will help us to confirm the oedema is not inflammatory in nature, as is the case with herpetic eye disease.   We will see him in November. Thank you very much for referring this 71 year old woman whom I saw in the clinic today.   DIAGNOSIS: bilateral early cataracts. Old left retinal vein occlusion with pan-retinal photocoagulation.

The patient has been advised of the importance of taking their topical medication. He has been given an appointment for post-operative review tomorrow and in 2 weeks time. Diagnosis: Right eye:    Pseudophakia Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy(NSC R2 and no evidence of photocoagulation) No macular oedema(NSC M1S and no evidence of photocoagulation)  Left eye:      Moderate cataract Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy(NSC R2 and no evidence of photocoagulation) No macular oedema(NSC M1S and no evidence of photocoagulation) Diabetes mellitus type 2  Visual acuity: Right Eye: 6/12 Pinhole Left Eye: 6/18 Unaided  Mrs ##### has significant cataract in the left eye, and is keen on surgery, so we have listed her for this. We have also prescribed lubricant drops. It was a pleasure to see Mrs ####### a nursing colleague in clinic today.  As you say, she has a very significant history of right sided epiphora.  Our assessment today indicates that this is due to nasolacrimal duct obstruction.  I have explained to her that she will require DCR lacrimal drainage surgery in order to improve her symptoms and she is keen to proceed.  We will arrange this for endonasal procedure to be booked under general anaesthesia in the near future. Diagnosis: Normal tension glaucoma  Treatment: Ganfort mane both eyes; Azopt bd both eyes  Follow-up: Listed for right trabeculectomy + MMC, LA daycase  Mrs ####### pressures were right: 15 mmHg, left: 16 mmHg.  She had progression of her right visual field and after discussion with her and Miss Jones we have listed her for right trabeculectomy.  I have asked her to stop the alphagan and continue with the treatment above.  I note that her blood pressure dips at night 110/50 and 85/50 compared to a day peak of 156/90.  She clearly needs blood pressure medication but I wonder whether a drug like losartan in the morning (she was intolerant to ramipril) might reduce the risk of nocturnal dipping which may be making her glaucoma worse.  I am not, however, an expert in blood pressure medication and will leave this in your hands.   If you do change her medication, I would be very grateful if you could arrange to repeat her 24h BP and give the results to her to bring to us.
